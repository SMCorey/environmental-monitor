  <p>A Simple IoT Project for presence detection using mmWave radar technology, using MQTT, plus a cross-platform desktop application.</p>
</div>

## 📋 Overview

This project consists of two main components:
1. **IoT Device**: ESP32-C6 based hardware with DFRobot SEN0395 mmWave radar sensor
2. **Desktop Application**: Cross-platform application built with Tauri, Svelte, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS


## 🔧 Technology Choices

This project leverages a carefully selected technology stack to provide an optimal balance of performance, developer experience, and cross-platform compatibility.

### Why Tauri + Rust

- **Incredibly Light Footprint**: Tauri applications are significantly smaller than Electron alternatives (3-10MB vs 100MB+), resulting in faster downloads, updates, and less resource usage.
- **Enhanced Security**: Rust's memory safety guarantees provide robust security without runtime overhead.
- **Performance Efficiency**: Rust's low-level control and zero-cost abstractions make it well-suited for processing real-time sensor data streams without introducing latency or performance bottlenecks.
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Build once and deploy across Windows, macOS, Linux, and mobile with native look and feel, dramatically reducing maintenance overhead.

### Why Svelte + TypeScript

- **Reactive by Design**: Svelte's built-in reactivity system is ideal for displaying continuously updating sensor data with minimal code and maximum performance.
- **Reduced Bundle Size**: Unlike traditional frameworks that ship their entire runtime to the browser, Svelte compiles components into highly optimized vanilla JavaScript at build time. This "disappearing framework" approach eliminates runtime overhead and results in significantly smaller bundles, perfectly complementing Tauri's lightweight philosophy.
- **Type Safety**: TypeScript provides compile-time error checking, better IDE support, and self-documenting code through its type system. This reduces runtime errors and simplifies maintenance, particularly valuable when multiple developers collaborate on a complex codebase.
- **Developer Experience**: Svelte's straightforward, declarative approach to building UIs reduces development time and makes maintenance more intuitive.

### MQTT for Connectivity

The project uses MQTT for device-to-application communication, offering several advantages:

- **Lightweight Protocol**: Designed for constrained devices and low-bandwidth, high-latency networks—perfect for IoT applications.
- **Publish/Subscribe Pattern**: Enables flexible data distribution with minimal network overhead.
- **Quality of Service Options**: Configurable message delivery guarantees ensure critical presence data is never lost.
- **Widespread Support**: Robust client libraries and broker implementations across platforms.

The desktop application leverages the operating system's native networking capabilities for WiFi connectivity, simplifying setup and improving reliability across platforms.

### Tailwind CSS for UI

- **Utility-First Approach**: Enables rapid UI development without leaving your HTML/Svelte files.
- **Consistent Design System**: Provides a cohesive look and feel across the entire application.
- **Minimal CSS Overhead**: Only includes the styles you actually use, keeping the application lightweight.

Together, this technology stack delivers a responsive, efficient, and secure application capable of handling complex real-time sensor data while providing an intuitive and pleasant user experience.
